<P>In RealTimeBattle, it is very simple to construct your own arenas. The
language consists of only eleven commands, and there are essentially
four building blocks: line, circle, inner_circle and arc. This is mainly
because of speed reason, for circles and lines it is very easy to
check if a collision has occured. Circle and inner_circle prevents
robots from entering into a circle or getting out of a circle
respectively. The line and the arc stop the robots from entering through
the long side ( the curved for the arc ), but no check is made on the
short side, so you have to put
circles at each end of the line to make it a solid object. The
commands <CODE>polygon</CODE>, <CODE>closed_polygon</CODE> and
<CODE>poly_curve</CODE> are intended to
simplify this procedure, always giving a proper object.</P>
<P>All angles are by default in radians but can be changed to degrees by the
command <CODE>angle_unit degrees</CODE>.</P>
<P>Note that RealTimeBattle does not check whether the arena file gives
a correct arena, it is entirely up to you. However, it will complain
if there are violations to the language rules.</P>
<P>Arena files should be given the postfix <CODE>.arena</CODE> and be stored
in the arena directory for RealTimeBattle to find them.</P>
<P>The <CODE>bounce coefficient</CODE> and <CODE>hardness</CODE> argument given to
all wall creating commands, determines the material of the wall. They
are both values between 0 and 1. Harder walls will injure colliding
robots more and higher bounce coefficient make them bounce better.</P>
<P>You are also encouraged to study the arenas included and learn from
the examples.</P>



<H2><A NAME="Arena_commands"></A> <A NAME="ss6.1">6.1</A> <A HREF="RealTimeBattle.html#toc6.1">Arena commands</A>
</H2>

<P>A command consists of the command name and the arguments separated by
whitespace. Be sure to give the right number of arguments!</P>
<P>In the command list, the arguments are given in square brackets.</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>scale [value]</B><DD>
<P>This value times the 
<A HREF="RealTimeBattle-5.html#ArenaScale">arena scale</A>
will give the scale factor, by which all coordinates are multiplied. This command must be,
if it exists, the very first in the file, default is 1.0.</P>

<DT><B>angle_unit [unit]</B><DD>
<P>Switches to the selected angle unit, which
can be either of <CODE>degrees</CODE> or <CODE>radians</CODE>. Default is radians.</P>

<DT><B>boundary [left] [up] [right] [down]</B><DD>
<P>The boundary encloses the area, in which robot,
cookies and mines are placed. It also determines the visible area in the 
<A HREF="RealTimeBattle-2.html#Arena_window">arena window</A>. This command is required and may only be preceded by
<CODE>scale</CODE>.</P>

<DT><B>inner_circle [bounce] [hardness] [center_x] [center_y] [radius]</B><DD>
<P>Robots are limited to the inside of this circle.</P>

<DT><B>circle [bounce] [hardness] [center_x] [center_y] [radius]</B><DD>
<P>Circle shaped wall.</P>

<DT><B>line [bounce] [hardness] [thickness] [start_x]
[start_y] [end_x] [end_y]</B><DD>
<P>Creates a line. It only prevents the robot from passing through to long
side, so remember to put circles at the short ends.</P>

<DT><B>arc [bnc] [hardn] [thickn] [center_x] [ctr_y]
[inner_radius] [outer_rds] [angle1] [angle2]</B><DD>
<P>An arc is a sector of a ring within two angles. Like the line, it needs
circles at both the ends.</P>


<DT><B>polygon [bounce] [hardn] [thickn] [number of vertices] ([center_x] [center_y])...</B><DD>
<P>This will create a number of circles, connected by lines.</P>


<DT><B>closed_polygon [bounce] [hardn] [thickn] [number of vertices]
([center_x] [center_y])...</B><DD>
<P>As a <CODE>polygon</CODE>, but the first and the last vertices are also
connected by a line.</P>

<DT><B>poly_curve [bnc] [hardn] [thickn] [start_x]
[start_y] [dir_x] [dir_y] 
([command args ...]) ...</B><DD>
<P>The <CODE>poly_curve</CODE> is the most powerful of the arena commands. It is
used to build walls with lines and arcs. At each step you have a current
position and direction, which are affected by the subcommands. The last
subcommand must be <CODE>C</CODE> or <CODE>Q</CODE>.</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>L [length]</B><DD>
<P>Draw a line with given length in the current
direction.</P>
<DT><B>T [angle]</B><DD>
<P>Turn the current dircetion.</P>
<DT><B>A [angle] [radius]</B><DD>
<P>Draw an arc.</P>
<DT><B>C</B><DD>
<P>Finish by connecting with the starting point.</P>
<DT><B>Q</B><DD>
<P>Quit.</P>
</DL>
</P>





<DT><B>exclusion_point [position_x] [position_y]</B><DD>
<P>When the arena
inside the boundary consists of several separated areas, you should
exclude all but one by inserting exclusion points. All points from
which you can draw a straight line to an exclusion point without
crossing a wall, are considered to be outside the arena.</P>
