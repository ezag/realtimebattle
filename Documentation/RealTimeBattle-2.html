<P>This chapter describes how to use the program itself. If you find it boring to
read it through, feel free to use trial and error as usual, and return here if you stumble
upon something confusing in the user interface. It is, however, a good idea to read the
short section on 
<A HREF="#Command line options">command line options</A> below. Note
also that there is no built-in help in the program - here is where you should search for
help.</P>


<H2><A NAME="Command line options"></A> <A NAME="ss2.1">2.1</A> <A HREF="RealTimeBattle.html#toc2.1">Command line options</A>
</H2>

<P>On the command line, there are two options to set which control the overall behaviour of
RealTimeBattle. Here you can choose the option file, which determines the default values of
the 
<A HREF="RealTimeBattle-5.html#Options">options</A>. You can also select in which game-mode the program
will run: <CODE>debug</CODE>, <CODE>normal</CODE> or <CODE>competition</CODE> mode.</P>
<P>

<PRE>
 Usage: RealTimeBattle [options] 

 Options:
    --debug_mode,                -d   debug mode
    --debug_level [0-5],         -D   sets the initial debug level. implies -d
    --normal_mode,               -n   normal mode (default)
    --competition_mode,          -c   competition mode

    --no_graphics,               -g   no graphics will be displayed
    --option_file [file],        -o   selects option-file (default: $HOME/.rtbrc)

    --log_file [file],           -l   make log file, if 'file' is '-'
                                      the log is sent to STDOUT

    --tournament_file [file],    -t   specify a tournament file to
                                      autostart a tournament

    --statistics_file [file],    -s   file to print the statistics to
                                       when autostarting

    --message_file [file],       -m   redirect messages to 'file'.
                                      '-' as 'file' is equivalent to STDOUT.
                                      If both log and messages are send
                                      to STDOUT, '-m' will be ignored

    --replay [file]              -r   a log file to replay.
                                      if '-' is specified as file,
                                      input is taken from STDIN

    --help,                      -h   prints this message
    --version,                   -v   prints the version number
    --port_number                -p   specifies the port for remote clients (default is 32134)  
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>The port_number option is only available, if you chose to compile RealTimeBattle with the --enable-network option.
See the <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> file for more information.
The differences between the three competition modes are shown in the following

the 
<A HREF="#Message window">message window</A>.</P>

<DT><B>Quit:</B><DD>
<P>Terminates the program.</P>

</DL>
</P>
<P>In 
<A HREF="#Command line options">debug-mode</A> there is another set of buttons available. They
are intended to help with debugging of robots. Note that you can debug a running process; if you use
<CODE>gdb</CODE> the command is <CODE>gdb robot-name process-number</CODE>.</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Step:</B><DD>
<P>In a 
<A HREF="#pause">paused</A> game this will move
one time step forward. This is very useful when running the robot in a
debugger, since otherwise the robot will be flooded with messages.</P>

<DT><B>End game:</B><DD>
<P>This will finish the current game. It has the same effect as a
<A HREF="RealTimeBattle-5.html#Timeout">timeout</A> would have.</P>

<A NAME="Debug level"></A> </P>
<DT><B>Debug level:</B><DD>
<P>Changing debug level is a way of telling robots which messages they

debugging, i.e. all debug-messages should be send.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>When you are replaying a logfile (not from stdout) there are a number of widgets to
control the replaying. See further in the chapter about

<P>To select robots and arenas for the tournament, mark the files to the
right and press the <CODE>add</CODE> button. Selected files are shown to
the left and can be removed correspondingly.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="NumberOfGames"></A> 
A 
<A HREF="RealTimeBattle-3.html#A_tournament">tournament</A> consists of a number of 
<A HREF="RealTimeBattle-3.html#A_sequence">sequences</A> of 
<A HREF="RealTimeBattle-3.html#A_game">games</A>. In each
sequence the same robots are playing in all games. Here you select the number of games
and sequences as well as the number of robots in each sequence. If you intend to play
with all robots every game you are advised to choose only one sequence and instead
increase the number of games. The reason is to avoid restarting of the robot processes
which can take a while, especially if the number of robots is large.</P>
<P>It is also possible to load a tournament file or save the current tournament.
The last tournament played is stored in /tmp/rtb/tmp.tour and is always displayed
when this window opens. If it is not available an empty tournament is displayed.</P>
<P>You have to select at least two robots and one arena to be able to
start.</P>

<H2><A NAME="robot_and_arena_directories"></A> <A NAME="ss2.4">2.4</A> <A HREF="RealTimeBattle.html#toc2.4">Robots and arena directories</A>
</H2>

<P>In order for the program to find the robots and arenas you have set two options
<A HREF="RealTimeBattle-5.html#Robot search path">Robot search path</A> and
<A HREF="RealTimeBattle-5.html#Arena search path">Arena search path</A>.
The subdirectories <CODE>Robots</CODE> and <CODE>Arenas</CODE> in the rtb installl
directory (default: <CODE>/usr/local/games/RealTimeBattle</CODE>), specified at compile-time in the
main Makefile, are always searched, regardless of the 
options, but if you create a new directory, or if you installed RealTimeBattle in some other
directory, you need to set these options.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Arena_window"></A> <A NAME="ss2.5">2.5</A> <A HREF="RealTimeBattle.html#toc2.5">Arena window</A>
</H2>

<P>This is where the battle takes place. If you want a more detailed view, use
the zoom buttons or press +, - or 0. The robots are visualized as coloured
circles with an angle shape showing the radar direction, the thick line is the
cannon and the thin line points in the front direction.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Score window"></A> <A NAME="ss2.6">2.6</A> <A HREF="RealTimeBattle.html#toc2.6">Score window</A>
</H2>

<P>In this window the robots playing in the current sequence are listed.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Message window"></A> <A NAME="ss2.7">2.7</A> <A HREF="RealTimeBattle.html#toc2.7">Message window</A>
</H2>

<P>Here are messages sent by the robots using 
<A HREF="RealTimeBattle-4.html#Print">Print and Debug</A> displayed. The
most recent messages are displayed at the top. You can clean the window and choose to only see new
messages from a particular robot.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Options_window"></A> <A NAME="ss2.8">2.8</A> <A HREF="RealTimeBattle.html#toc2.8">Options window</A>
</H2>

<P>Here you can change a number of options. In the 
<A HREF="RealTimeBattle-5.html#Options">Options chapter</A> you can
get detailed information on each option. The changes are not applied until either the <CODE>apply</CODE>
button or the <CODE>OK</CODE> button is pressed. </P>
<P>You can save your options to a file: <CODE>Save options</CODE> will save the options to a file of your
choice and <CODE>Save as default</CODE> will save them to <CODE>.rtbrc</CODE> in your home directory.</P>
<P>The <CODE>Default</CODE> button will reset all options to their default values.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Statistics window"></A> <A NAME="ss2.9">2.9</A> <A HREF="RealTimeBattle.html#toc2.9">Statistics window</A>
</H2>

<P>You can study the statistics of the current tournament in some
different ways. You can either display</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> statistics on individual <B>Robot</B>s,
</LI>
<LI> the result of a <B>game</B>,
</LI>
<LI> the <B>sequence total</B> or
</LI>
<LI> the <B>total</B> of the tournament.
</LI>
</UL>

Pressing the arrowed buttons will move you to the first, back one,
forward one or to the last element respectively. The middle bar will
show what is displayed and pressing it will update the statistics if
the game is in progress. If you are using gtk+1.1.x, it is also possible to sort with respect to
different columns by clicking on the corresponding title box.</P>

<H2><A NAME="no_graphics"></A> <A NAME="ss2.10">2.10</A> <A HREF="RealTimeBattle.html#toc2.10">Running without graphics</A>
</H2>

<P>If you want, you can run RealTimeBattle without any graphics at all. This can be
especially useful when currying out a long series of tests or running a competition. To
use this option you have two choices: Either you add the flag <CODE>-g</CODE> when
launching the program, or you disable the graphics at compile time (see the
<CODE>INSTALL</CODE> file for more information). The latter alternative is useful as the
executable gets smaller and therefore faster on low memory machines. It also enables
you to run RealTimeBattle on machines which haven't got <CODE>gtk+</CODE> installed.</P>
<P>When running without graphics you have to give a tournament file, otherwise nothing at
all will happen. It is also a good idea to create a log file and/or a statistics file
if you want to know the result.</P>


<H2><A NAME="tournament_files"></A> <A NAME="ss2.11">2.11</A> <A HREF="RealTimeBattle.html#toc2.11">Tournament files</A>
</H2>


<P>The tournament file is specified as a 
<A HREF="#Command line options">command line option</A>.
When specified a tournament will automatically begin and end. To save the statistics see section
<A HREF="#statistics_files">statistics file</A> for more information.</P>
<P>A tournament file consists of five keywords. All of these keywords can be written several
times, but keep in mind that only the last one of the keywords that takes a number as argument is
counted. All keywords should be followed by a semicolon.</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Games/Sequence or g/s:</B><DD>
<P>Takes a number or a <CODE>*</CODE> as an argument. The
number is how many games should be played per tournament. The asterisk means that the
program takes the exact amount of arenas and uses this as the argument. The default
value is 1. </P>

<DT><B>Robots/Sequence or r/s:</B><DD>
<P>Takes a number or a <CODE>*</CODE> as an argument. The
number is how many robots is playing in each sequence. The asterisk means that the
program takes the exact amount of robots and uses this as the argument. The default
value is 2.</P>

<DT><B>Sequences or seq:</B><DD>
<P>Takes a number or a <CODE>*</CODE> as an argument. This
number tells how many sequences shall be played in the tournament. The asterisk means
that the program takes the exact amount of robots and the robots per sequence, does a
binomial calculation to determine the number of sequence for all robots to meet each
other exactly once, and uses this number as the argument.  The default value is 1.</P>

<DT><B>Robots or r:</B><DD>
<P>Takes one or more robot files as its argument.</P>

<DT><B>Arenas or a:</B><DD>
<P>Takes one or more arena files as its argument.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>File arguments can be one of the following:
<DL>
<DT><B>Just the file:</B><DD>
<P>This searches the path for the file</P>
<P>Example: <CODE>Robot: empty.robot</CODE></P>

<DT><B>Full path to the file:</B><DD>
<P>This takes the given file</P>
<P>Example: <CODE>Arena: /usr/local/games/RealTimeBattle/Arenas/Circle.arena</CODE></P>

<DT><B>All files in path:</B><DD>
<P>This searches the whole path and takes all files found.</P>
<P>Example: <CODE>Arena: *</CODE></P>

<DT><B>One specific directory:</B><DD>
<P>This searches the specified directory and takes all files found. </P>
<P>Example: <CODE>Robot: /usr/local/games/RealTimeBattle/Robots/*</CODE></P>

</DL>
</P>
<P>It is possible to write files more than one time. So if you want three rotate_and_fire.robot. Just
write rotate_and_fire.robot three times. This is also true for <CODE>*</CODE>.</P>
<P>Example tournament file:</P>
<P><CODE>R: * Arenas: Circle.arena Square.arena G/S: 2 r/s: 3 Sequences: *</CODE></P>

<H2><A NAME="log_files"></A> <A NAME="ss2.12">2.12</A> <A HREF="RealTimeBattle.html#toc2.12">Log files</A>
</H2>

<P>Sometimes it can be useful to 
<A HREF="#replaying">replay</A> a game
and analyze it in detail or just to store for future reference, in this
case log files can be useful. Add the flag <CODE>-l</CODE>, when starting
RealTimeBattle, with the filename as argument to enable this feature and
with argument <CODE>'-'</CODE>, the log is printed to stdout.</P>
<P>The format of the log file is as follows: Each line consist of a letter, determining
the type of information, followed by a whitespace-separated list of arguments. The
following information is given:
<DL>
<DT><B>Header:</B><DD>
<P>H [games/sequence] [robots/sequence] [sequences] [robots]</P>
<DT><B>Arena info:</B><DD>
<P>A [line from the arena file]</P>

<H2><A NAME="replaying"></A> <A NAME="ss2.13">2.13</A> <A HREF="RealTimeBattle.html#toc2.13">Replaying</A>
</H2>

<P>You can replay a game from its 
<A HREF="#log_files">log file</A> either
by giving the 
<A HREF="#Command line options">command line option</A>
<CODE>&#34;-r&#34;</CODE> or from the 
<A HREF="#Control window">control window</A>.
Note that if the log is coming from standard input (command line option
<CODE>&#34;-r&nbsp;-&#34;</CODE>), you cannot do much but watch the game, but otherwise
you can influence the flow of the game:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> The slidebar at the top shows how far the current game has progressed. You
can jump wherever you want in the game by dragging the handle.
</LI>
<LI> Fast forward and rewind work as expected. You can alter the speed
by changing the option 
<A HREF="RealTimeBattle-5.html#Fast forward factor">fast forward factor</A>.
</LI>
<LI> Step forward and step backward can be used to study what happens in
detail. First, however, the game should be 
<A HREF="#pause">paused</A>.
</LI>
<LI> With the four bottom buttons you can jump between games and
sequences.</LI>
</UL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="statistics_files"></A> <A NAME="ss2.14">2.14</A> <A HREF="RealTimeBattle.html#toc2.14">Statistics files</A>
</H2>

<P>The statistics file is a file used only when a 
<A HREF="#tournament_files">tournament file</A> is specified. The statistics will be
saved to this file when the tournament ends. Otherwise you can save it by hand using
the <CODE>save</CODE> button in the
