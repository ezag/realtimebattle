If you do not get one robot per robot directory, you do not have certain compilers or API's needed on your system.
Simply read the output of configure to find out what is missing. If you do not have certain features, the related robot will be left out.


Robots in the directory rtb-team-framework:

For more information about sophisticated teamplay possibilities in RTB and configuration take a look on http://rtb-team.sourceforge.net.
We have included only a first tutorial strategy for our framework: brotfrucht
Should you have any problems compiling rtb-team so that the whole building process will stop and you cannot procede with some quirks, please
a) write a bug report to jonico@users.sourceforge.net
b) simply remove the rtb-team-framework directory and start configure again, so you can enjoy the rest of the extra stuff included in this edition 8-)

brotfrucht<...>.robot: There are as much robots because they are all individual, so you can't let one of them participate twice or more in a game.
Furthermore, brotfrucht will only work if you have ABSOLUTE COORDINATES activated in RealTimeBattle.
The binary for every robot for the framework is the same, only the configuration files differ.
The brotfrucht robots log into the /tmp/ directory, so look there if something won't work.


Robots in the Robots directory with some special issues:

joypad_robot: This robot needs a joystick on /dev/js0 or /dev/input/js0 and a working linux joystick api to let it work.
It can be started only ONCE.
joypad_robot_analog: This robot needs a joystick on /dev/js0 or /dev/input/js0 and a working linux joystick api to let it work.
It can be started only ONCE.

jBot.robot: You will need Java and a startup time in RealTimeBattle of about half and a second to let this robot work.

perl.robot, perl-Skeleton.robot: As the name says, you will need Perl in order to start these robots. perl.robot will create a log file located at /tmp/perl.robot.log

raziel.py.robot: You will need Python in order to run this robot.

*.php.robot: You will need PHP in order to run these robots.
